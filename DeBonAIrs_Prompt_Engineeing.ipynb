Within our engineering notebook, we meticulously document the iterative process of refining our LM, ensuring its accuracy and relevance across a diverse range of travel-related prompts. A core aspect of our workflow involves systematically evaluating the model's output for prompts, enabling us to fine-tune its performance and deliver high-quality, human-like responses. Through innovation and dedication to excellence, we aim to revolutionize the travel experience, empowering users with intelligent AI-driven solutions that enhance planning, exploration, and engagement with the world."
